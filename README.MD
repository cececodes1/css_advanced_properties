## Assignment 1: Enhancing Web Design with RGBA Colors

### Objective

The goal of this assignment is to explore how **RGBA** (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) colors can be used in web design to create visually appealing web pages. You will apply RGBA to background colors, text, and buttons to achieve dynamic, layered designs.

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Apply RGBA Background Colors

- **Goal**: Create a CSS class named `.background-fade` and apply it to a `div` element to create a blue, semi-transparent background using RGBA.
- **Expected Outcome**: A `div` element with a semi-transparent blue background that partially reveals the elements behind it.

#### Task 2: Enhance Text Visibility with RGBA

- **Goal**: Enhance the visibility of an `h1` header by adding a text shadow using RGBA, giving the text a soft shadow effect for better readability.
- **Expected Outcome**: The `h1` text should stand out with a white color and a subtle shadow for enhanced legibility against a background.

#### Task 3: Interactive Buttons with RGBA Hover Effects

- **Goal**: Create a button with an RGBA background and implement a hover effect that changes the background color to a different RGBA value when hovered.
- **Expected Outcome**: A button that changes color smoothly when hovered over, providing dynamic visual feedback to the user.

## Assignment 2: Creating Interactive Web Elements with CSS Animations and Transitions

### Objective

The second part of the assignment focuses on improving interactivity using **CSS animations** and **transitions**. I applied animations and transitions to links, buttons, and icons to create a more engaging user experience.

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Smooth Hover Transition for Links

- **Goal**: Implement a CSS transition effect for all `<a>` (hyperlink) elements so that their color changes smoothly when hovered.
- **Expected Outcome**: Hyperlinks that smoothly change their color when hovered, enhancing the interactive feedback for users.

#### Task 2: Animated Button on Click

- **Goal**: Apply a keyframe animation to a button so that it slightly increases in size when clicked, providing visual feedback of the interaction.
- **Expected Outcome**: A button that grows in size when clicked, offering immediate visual feedback to the user.

#### Task 3: Continuous Rotation Animation for an Icon

- **Goal**: Add a continuous rotation animation to an icon or image to make it visually engaging.
- **Expected Outcome**: An icon or image that continuously rotates, adding dynamic visual appeal to the webpage.
